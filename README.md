# Winter Olympics
A simple set of interactive visualizations of winter olympic medals, built to demonstrate charting with React. Data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games/data). Charts were built with [react-vis](https://uber.github.io/react-vis/) (treemap) and [recharts](http://recharts.org/#/en-US/) (stacked bar chart).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
